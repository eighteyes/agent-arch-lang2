# ADR 004: System Integration and Coordination

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system needs clear patterns for component integration, state management, and coordination between agents. We needed to determine how to share functionality and track progress.

## Decision
We will implement the following integration patterns:

1. Common Modules
   - Shared utilities in common module directory
   - Common event bus implementation
   - Shared document processors
   - Central file operations

2. State Management
   - Track agent completion status
   - "Done" flag per agent
   - Phase completion tracking
   - Re-run state handling

3. File Organization
   - Central /docs/ directory for outputs
   - Standardized file access
   - Clear output locations

4. System Coordination
   - "Agent Orchestra" pattern
     * Conductor module coordinates agent execution
     * Tracks agent completion status
     * Manages phase transitions
     * Handles re-run requests

   - "Document Hub" pattern
     * Central document coordination
     * Standardized access patterns
     * Validation orchestration
     * Metadata management

   - "Event Nexus" pattern
     * Centralized event management
     * Cross-agent communication
     * State broadcasts
     * Timeout coordination

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear module organization
- Simple state tracking
- Standardized file management
- Coordinated agent interactions
- Creative coordination patterns

### Negative
- Additional abstraction layer
- Potential coordination overhead
- More complex state tracking
- Directory structure requirements

## Alternatives Considered

### Distributed State Management
- Each agent manages own state
- Rejected for centralized tracking

### Individual File Management
- Agents manage own files
- Rejected for standardization

### Direct Agent Communication
- No central coordinator
- Rejected for orchestration benefits

## Implementation Notes
- Create common module structure
- Implement agent completion tracking
- Set up /docs/ directory structure
- Build coordination patterns
- Add state broadcasting
