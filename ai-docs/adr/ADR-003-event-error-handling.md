# ADR 003: Event System and Error Handling

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system requires clear patterns for event handling, error management, and user interaction. We needed to determine how agents would communicate, handle errors, and manage document validation.

## Decision
We will implement the following patterns:

1. Event System
   - Each agent listens for specific events (see [ADR-004](ADR-004-system-integration.md) for integration details)
   - 30-second timeout for agent operations
   - Support for phase re-runs
   - Event-based execution flow through common event bus

2. Error Handling
   - User consultation for conflicts
   - Pause execution on agent concerns
   - User intervention for processing failures
   - Document validation before writes

3. Document Management
   - Markdown links for cross-references
   - Automatic metadata addition
   - Pre-write validation
   - Emoji-based urgency indicators

4. Question Management
   - Batch answer section at q.md top
   - Emoji indicators for urgency
   - User consultation for format errors
   - Support for need-based phase activation

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear error escalation path
- Consistent document validation
- Flexible phase management
- Simple urgency indication
- Structured batch answers

### Negative
- Frequent user interventions
- Potential timeout issues
- Manual conflict resolution
- Metadata maintenance overhead

## Alternatives Considered

### Automatic Conflict Resolution
- Could reduce user intervention
- Rejected in favor of user control

### Complex Timeout Handling
- More sophisticated retry logic
- Rejected for simplicity

### Automated Metadata
- Fully automated metadata generation
- Rejected to maintain control

## Implementation Notes
- Implement event listeners per agent
- Add timeout mechanisms
- Create document validation system
- Support markdown link validation
- Add emoji processing for urgency
- Implement batch answer parsing
