# ADR 002: Technical Stack Decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system requires a robust technical foundation for implementing the agent-based planning system. Key considerations include the LangChain implementation, agent architecture, file processing, and system design.

## Decision
We will implement the system with the following technical choices:

1. Core Framework
   - LangChain Python as the primary framework
   - Higher-level chains for agent composition
   - Utilize built-in LangChain tools where available
   - Custom tools for specialized file operations

2. Agent Architecture
   - Function-based agent implementation
   - Event system for agent orchestration (see [ADR-003](ADR-003-event-error-handling.md))
   - No persistent agent memory
   - File-based context sharing (see [ADR-004](ADR-004-system-integration.md))
   - Debug-level error handling with agent name tracking

3. File Management
   - Markdown parser/writer for document processing
   - Text files with metadata for prompt storage
   - File-based context distribution

## Consequences

### Positive
- Simplified agent implementation through functions
- Flexible composition through higher-level chains
- Clear error tracking with agent attribution
- Standardized document processing
- Reduced complexity without persistent state

### Negative
- May require additional error handling
- Potential overhead from file operations
- Limited agent persistence capabilities
- Event system complexity

## Alternatives Considered

### Class-based Agents
- More structured but less flexible
- Rejected in favor of simpler function-based approach

### Direct LLM Integration
- Lower-level control
- Rejected in favor of higher-level chains for better composition

### Persistent Agent Memory
- Could provide historical context
- Rejected to maintain simplicity and file-based approach

## Implementation Notes
- Implement consistent event system patterns
- Ensure proper agent naming in logs
- Standardize metadata format for prompt files
- Utilize LangChain's built-in tools where possible
- Implement robust error handling with debug information
