# ADR 005: Phased Delivery Approach

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system needs a clear implementation strategy that delivers functional modules incrementally while maintaining cohesion. We needed to determine how to structure phases and define completion criteria.

## Decision
We will implement a modular, phase-based delivery approach:

1. Phase Structure
   - Each phase delivers one functional module
   - Clear milestone definitions
   - Sequential development
   - No parallel execution

2. Milestone Definition
   - Milestone = Functional module completion
   - Phase completion criteria
   - Clear deliverables
   - Testable outcomes

3. Development Flow
   - Sequential phase execution
   - Module-based progression
   - Regular pivot points
   - Experimental validation

4. Phase Organization
   - Core infrastructure first
   - Component systems second
   - Agent implementation third
   - Integration last

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear progress tracking
- Modular development
- Simple dependency management
- Regular validation points
- Focused development

### Negative
- Sequential limitations
- Longer total timeline
- Limited parallelization
- Fixed module order

## Alternatives Considered

### Feature-based Phases
- Organize by features rather than modules
- Rejected for clarity and cohesion

### Parallel Development
- Multiple modules simultaneously
- Rejected for simplicity

### Capability-based Phases
- Organize by system capabilities
- Rejected for module clarity

## Implementation Notes
- Maintain clear phase boundaries
- Document module completions
- Track milestone achievements
- Plan experiments carefully
- Monitor pivot points
