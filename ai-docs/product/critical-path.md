# Critical Path

## Core System Flow

1. System Initialization
   - Process initial input/context
   - Import external documentation (if provided)
   - Initialize q.md for question management

2. Discovery Phase
   - Generate initial questions
   - Process user responses
   - Create vision and requirements documents

3. Architecture Phase
   - Review discovery outputs
   - Define technical approach
   - Create core structures

4. Logic & Systems Integration
   - Define component flows
   - Document patterns
   - Connect components
   - Ensure system cohesion

5. Interface Definition (If Required)
   - API documentation
   - UI/UX planning
   - Navigation patterns

6. Project Planning
   - Create phased outline
   - Define milestones
   - Plan experiments

7. Delivery & Validation
   - Review all documents
   - Ensure consistency
   - Final validation

## Essential Features

### Question Management (Priority 1)
- Centralized q.md file
- Agent-specific sections
- Simple notation format
- Support for deferred questions

### Agent Orchestration (Priority 1)
- Sequential execution flow
- Independent operation capability
- Inter-agent communication
- Concern escalation

### File Management (Priority 1)
- Independent agent outputs
- Markdown format standardization
- External input support

### User Interaction (Priority 2)
- Question-answer cycles
- Choice-based decisions
- Minimal feedback loop

## Dependencies
- LangChain integration
- Markdown processing
- File system operations
- Agent communication protocol

## Pivot Points
1. After Discovery Phase
   - Validate understanding of requirements
   - Confirm agent structure

2. After Architecture Phase
   - Validate technical approach
   - Confirm component structure

3. Before Interface Definition
   - Determine if API/UI documentation needed
   - Adjust agent workflow accordingly

4. Before Delivery
   - Validate document consistency
   - Confirm all requirements addressed
