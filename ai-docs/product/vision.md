# Vision: Agentic Software Planning System

## Purpose
To create an intelligent, collaborative system that facilitates the creation of software delivery plans through specialized agents engaging in structured dialogue with users.

## Core Value Proposition
- Streamlined software planning through specialized agent collaboration
- Structured question-answer workflow reducing planning complexity
- Flexible agent system that can work sequentially or independently
- Clear separation of concerns through agent specialization

## Key Principles
1. Sequential by Default, Independent When Needed
   - Agents primarily operate in sequence
   - Support for independent operation when beneficial
   - Clear communication channels between agents

2. Structured Collaboration
   - Centralized question management in q.md
   - Header-based separation of agent concerns
   - Direct inter-agent communication for issues

3. User-Centric Design
   - Minimal feedback overhead
   - Support for deferred questions
   - Focus on providing choices rather than decisions
   - Simple question-answer format

4. Flexible Integration
   - Support for external documentation import
   - Independent file outputs per agent
   - Ability to handle partial or incomplete information

## Success Criteria
- Agents successfully collaborate to produce coherent delivery plans
- Questions and answers flow smoothly between agents and users
- Output documents maintain consistency across agent interactions
- System adapts to varying levels of input detail and completeness
